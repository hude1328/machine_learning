In this assignment, you will build an image classifier and 
then deploy the classifier as a chatbot on Telegram.


You will build a system which offer image classification 
service via Telegram bot. A user in Telegram can either send 
an image or the URL of an image to the bot, and the bot will 
feed the image (download the image first if it is given a URL) 
into a deep learning model to generate image classification 
predictions, and then send back the result to the user.



PS: image classification model based on Pytorch Inception V3 model.
