In this assignment, you will create an application that performs object 
recognition using a deep learning model.

There are three components in this system:

1 main.py: a program that keep reading user input from the command prompt, 
and is also responsible for printing out the results for the user to read.

2 image_downloader.py: a program that is responsible for downloading images 
from either Telegram or a given URL

3 predict.py: a program that loads a PyTorch pre-trained model for object 
recognition, and generates predictions when given an image



These three programmes are assumed to be located on different servers, and 
you should achieve connections between them with asychronous messaging using 
Redis.
