In this assignment, you will build a text classifier of movie reviews, and then deploy 
the text classifier as a chatbot on Telegram to allow other people to use it. The task
you will be working on is a binary classification problem: given a movie review, 
determine if it is positive or negative.



We will use a dataset of movie reviews collected from IMDb, which is a movie 
database where Internet users can leave their comments about movies. 
The dataset can be obtained from the following Webpage: 
http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/.



Your bot should fulfil the following requirements:

Whenever it receives a message from a user, it should pass the message into the 
text classification model.
If the model predicts that it is positive, the bot should say “This is a positive 
review!”, otherwise the bot should say “This is a negative review!”.
At the end of the message, you should append also the probability of the predicted 
class, up to 2 decimal places
